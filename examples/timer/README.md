# Timer Example

[main.c](./main.c) has several adjustable data points that can be changed. Once you start the program---command below to build and and run---you have 10 seconds to make whatever changes to [main.c](./main.c) that you want. Then it will update everything and print out the updated results.

```
gcc -std=c89 -I/adjust.h main.c
./a.out
```
