# Examples

## Timer Examples

Adjust supports several simple types, and there are example files in this directory for each:

- [type_bool.c](./type_bool.c)
- [type_char.c](./type_char.c) // not implemented yet...
- [type_float.c](./type_float.c)
- [type_int.c](./type_int.c)
- [type_string.c](./type_string.c)

These can all be built with `make` and cleaned up with `make clean`.

## Raylib Example

There is a `raylib` example in [raylib-example](./raylib-example) that builds with CMake.
